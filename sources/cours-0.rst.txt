Content & Evaluation
----------------------

Our objective in this course is to introduce you to some concepts and notions in Multi-Agent systems. It alternates lecture parts (in COVID context, we chose to provide you with as much information as possible to allow you to understand the course by yourself) with practical work (which means that you'll have to implement things to understand the underlying concepts). 

The first three sessions will give you the basics of MAS architectures and platforms. Based on this knowledge, 
you will implement a simple multi-agent based simulation (session 2). After that, sessions 3 to 7 will be dedicated to a more complex project that combines 
argumentation and negotiation models with the MAS architecture. This will give rise to a second multi-agent based model.

The evaluation during this course will take into account: the multi-agent based simulation (session 2) and the argumentation-based negoitiation model (session 7).
This evaluation will be based on your source code and a very short report of your work (see the requirements in sessions 2 & 7). 
Its aim is to assess that you have acquired the basics of the notions adressed in the course.

Python and implementation 
---------------------------

All implementation in this course is done using the Python programming language (Mesa libreary). The reason for this is that students at CentraleSup√©lec are familiar with this language. However, it is important to note that existing multiagent platforms mostly use different high-level programming languages such as Java, C++ or C#. Indeed, these languages are more time-efficient, they better support parallel computing, network-based architectures or object-oriented models. 
The most popular multiagent platforms are `Jade <https://jade.tilab.com/>`_ (especially for system programming) and `Repast Symphony <https://repast.github.io/>`_ (especially for social simulation). Both use the Java programming language.


- Make sure your environment is set up with Python 3.

- Please use your favorite IDE for programming in Python. We do not care if you prefer to use Pycharm, Visual Studio, pyzo or a Jupyter notebook..., as long as you structure your work in separate files and folders (as it is suggested along the course).

- Install the mesa library:
  
  - in a terminal : ``pip install mesa`` (some of you may use pip3)
  
  - in a notebook: ``!pip install mesa``

  - test in a python environment: ``import mesa`` (it should not rise an error)
