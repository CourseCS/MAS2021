2. Friday, March the 12th, 2021 : Multiagent simulation : preys and predators
3. Friday, March the 19th, 2021 : Interaction mechanisms : models and implementation
4. Friday, March the 26th, 2021 : Argumentation-based negotiation I: Practical session
5. Friday, April the 2nd, 2021 :  Argumentation-based negotiation II: what is argumentation?
6. Friday, April the 9th, 2021 :  Argumentation-based negotiation III: what is a negotiation protocol?
7. Friday, April the 16th, 2021 : Argumentation-based negotiation IV: Practical session


Session 1. 
-------------

This first session aims at defining and guiding you through the comprehension of the notions of *autonomous agent* and *multi-agent system* (a.k.a. MAS).We shall begin with a brief history of MAS (first part). We then present the computational definition of an agent and we question its implementation (second part).  The third part of the course will introduce to the *Mesa library* for agent-based modelling.

The understanding of concepts through their implementation in Python is an important part of this session. Take the time to achieve all practical exercises to understand the difficulty of MAS programming before you switch to the Mesa library (which does all the job for you).
