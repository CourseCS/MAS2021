3.4. Interactions in the Mesa library
=======================================

**Mesa** is a Python framework for agent-based modeling. You have already created a simple model and progressively added functionality which have illustrated Mesa's core features (first course session, section 4). Now, we will implement in **Mesa** a direct interactions mechanism: messaging communication.

1. Implementing messaging communication in Mesa
-------------------------------------------------

With the **Mesa** library, it is possible to set up indirect interaction mechanisms through the environment (like a *blackboard* or *stigmergy* mechanism, see today's session, section 1). However, it does not handle direct interactions such as message communication. So, first, we will implement our own communication layer in **Mesa**. This communication layer will be necessary for the realization of the final project.

As seen previously, the messaging communication in MAS is a four step mechanism.

Before implementing the communicating agents and according to the picture, we must create: (1) a ``Message`` object, (2) a ``Mailbox`` object and (3) a list of allowed performative for messages.

To do so, create a new folder hierarchy as shown in the following picture:

.. image:: img/part5_folders.png
    :align: center

Here is the description of what each folder will contains:

- **mesa**: root folder which will contain your python codes using the communication layer;
- **communication**: the root folder of the communication layer;
- **agent**: the folder which will contain the implementation of the communicating agent class;
- **mailbox**: the folder which will contain the implementation of the mailbox class;
- **message**: the folder which will contain the implementation of the message and performative class.

Create an *__init__.py* file in the **communication**, **agent**, **mailbox** and **message** folders to initiate python packages.

As everything is setting up, we can now move on to the implementation of the communication layer.


.. _q1:

Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter the **message** folder and create a new *Message.py* file. Let's open this file and implement the ``Message`` class. The purpose of this ``Message`` class is to create a python message object containing the receiver and sender identifiers but also the performative of the message sent as well as a content. Agents will exchange information using these items during their communication phases. The ``Message`` class is therefore composed of four attributes, four accessor methods (used to access the state of the object i.e, the data hidden in the object can be accessed from this method) and a string method (which returns a string, which is considered an informal or nicely printable representation of the message object).

The four attributes of the ``Message`` class are: 

- *from_agent*: the sender of the message identified by its id;
- *to_agent*: the receiver of the message identified by its id;
- *message_performative*: the performative of the message;
- *content*: the content of the message.

The four accessor methods of the ``Message`` class are: 

- *get_exp()*: return the sender of the message;
- *get_dest()*: return the receiver of the message;
- *get_performative()*: return the performative of the message;
- *get_content()*: return the content of the message.

**Practice yourself!**: you can try to implement this class by your own!

.. note::

   a possible implementation of the ``Message`` class is :ref:`codemessageclass`.




Now that we have a usable ``Message`` object, we are going to create the set of allowed message performatives from a python enumeration. We will define seven message performatives for the moment. It will be very easy to add more later. The seven performatives are as follows:

- propose;
- accept;
- commit;
- ask why;
- argue;
- query;
- inform.

In the **message** folder, create a new file called *MessagePerformative.py*. Open it and implement the ``MessagePerformative`` enumeration class.

.. note::
   
   a possible implementation of the ``MessagePerformative`` class is :ref:`codemessageperformativeclass`

.. _q2:

Mailbox
~~~~~~~~~~

To manage messages, each communicating agent will have his own mailbox. The purpose of this class is to provide to agents some mechanisms for handling sent and received messages. So, go to the **mailbox** folder and create a new *Mailbox.py* file. Let's open this file and implement the ``Mailbox`` class which is composed of two attributes and five methods.

The two attributes of the ``Mailbox`` class are:

- *unread_messages*: the list of unread messages;
- *read_messages*: the list of read messages.

The five methods of the ``Mailbox`` class are:

- *receive_messages(message)*: receive a message and add it in the unread messages list;
- *get_new_messages()*: return all the messages from unread messages list;
- *get_messages()*: return all the messages from both unread and read messages list;
- *get_messages_from_performative(performative)*: return a list of messages which have the same performative;
- *get_messages_from_exp(exp)*: return a list of messages which have the same sender.

**Practice yourself!**: you can try to implement this class by your own!

.. note::

   A possible implementation of the ``Mailbox`` class is :ref:`mailboxclass`




The ``Message`` and ``Mailbox`` classes being created, we will test them. Go to the **communication** folder and create a new *runtests.py* file. In this file, we will incrementally add tests to verify that our implementations are working well.

.. image:: img/part5_folders_mailbox.png
    :align: center

**Practice yourself!**

Let's start testing the ``Mailbox`` class: using the ``assert()`` function. Create three messages with various performatives, one mailbox and test the different methods of the ``Mailbox`` class (``receive_messages(message)``, ``get_new_messages()``, ``get_messages()``, ``get_messages_from_exp()`` and ``get_messages_from_performative()``). Before looking at the solution, try to implement the tests by your own.

.. note::

    A possible implementation of the *runtests.py* file is :ref:`runtest`


If you see all the *OK* messages appear, it means that your classes are well implemented and will behave correctly. This is called doing unit tests. It is very important in making sure your code is robust and bugs free.

Message Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, each agent will have their own mailbox instance and will be able to exchange messages. However, there are still no mechanisms to ensure that sent messages reach the right agents. As agents must not directly drop messages in the mailboxes of the other agents, we need to create a service (a message transport mechanism) which will be managed by the environment and which will take care of the management of message shipments and deliveries.

Go to the **message** folder and create a new *MessageService.py* file. Let's open this file and paste the ``MessageService`` class implementation that you can find below:

.. code:: python

	#!/usr/bin/env python3

	class MessageService:
		"""MessageService class.
		Class implementing the message service used to dispatch messages between communicating agents.

		Not intended to be created more than once: it's a singleton.

		attr:
			scheduler: the scheduler of the SMA (Scheduler)
			instant_delivery: the instant delivery status of the MessageService
			messages_to_proceed: the list of message to proceed mailbox of the agent (list)
		"""

		__instance = None

		@staticmethod
		def get_instance():
			""" Static access method.
			"""
			return MessageService.__instance

		def __init__(self, scheduler, instant_delivery=True):
			""" Create a new MessageService object.
			"""
			if MessageService.__instance is not None:
				raise Exception("This class is a singleton!")
			else:
				MessageService.__instance = self
				self.__scheduler = scheduler
				self.__instant_delivery = instant_delivery
				self.__messages_to_proceed = []

		def set_instant_delivery(self, instant_delivery):
			""" Set the instant delivery parameter.
			"""
			self.__instant_delivery = instant_delivery

		def send_message(self, message):
			""" Dispatch message if instant delivery active, otherwise add the message to proceed list.
			"""
			if self.__instant_delivery:
				self.dispatch_message(message)
			else:
				self.__messages_to_proceed.append(message)

		def dispatch_message(self, message):
			""" Dispatch the message to the right agent.
			"""
			self.find_agent_from_name(message.get_dest()).receive_message(message)

		def dispatch_messages(self):
			""" Proceed each message received by the message service.
			"""
			if len(self.__messages_to_proceed) > 0:
				for message in self.__messages_to_proceed:
					self.dispatch_message(message)

			self.__messages_to_proceed.clear()

		def find_agent_from_name(self, agent_name):
			""" Return the agent according to the agent name given.
			"""
			for agent in self.__scheduler.agents:
				if agent.get_name() == agent_name:
					return agent

As you can see, this class implement a ``MessageService`` object which is a *singleton*: it can only be instantiated once. Thus, there can only be one postal service in the MAS. This service has three attributes, one mutator method and four methoods.

The three attributes of the ``MessageService`` class are:

- *scheduler*: the scheduler of the SMA initialized in the **Mesa** model;
- *instant_delivery*: the instant delivery status of the MessageService. If ``True``, the message will be delivered instantly in the mailbox of the agent;
- *messages_to_proceed*: the list of message to proceed.

The mutator method of the ``MessageService`` class is:

- *set_instant_delivery(instant_delivery)*: change the instant delivery status of the MessageService.

The four methods of the ``MessageService`` class are:

- *send_message(message)*: dispatch a given message if instant delivery is actived, otherwise add the message in the MessageService message list to be proceeded after;
- *dispatch_message(message)*: dispatch the given message to the right agent;
- *dispatch_messages()*: proceed and dispatch each message received by the message service;
- *find_agent_from_name(agent_name)*: return the agent according to the agent name given.

**How to use ``MessageService`` class**

As described previously, the ``MessageService`` will be in charge of distributing the sent messages to the right agents. To use ``MessageService``, it is necessary to instantiate it in the constructor of the **Mesa** ``Model`` and give it as parameter the reference of the ``Scheduler``:

.. code:: python

	def __init__(self):
        self.schedule = RandomActivation(self)
        self.__messages_service = MessageService(self.schedule)
		...

Then, just call the method ``dispatch_messages()`` of the ``MessageService`` in the ``step()`` method of the **Mesa** ``Model``.

.. code:: python

    def step(self):
		...
		self.__messages_service.dispatch_messages()
		...

The ``MessageService`` can dispatch the messages instantly or at each time step. You can change this behavior by calling the ``set_instant_delivery(isntantly)`` method and give as parameter a ``Boolean`` which represents by its value the activation or not of the instantaneous mode.

.. code:: python

	MessageService.get_instance().set_instant_delivery(False)

.. _q3:

Communicating Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We now have all the tools implemented: (1) ``Message``, (2) ``MessagePerformative``, (3) ``Mailbox`` and (4) ``MessageService``. We are going to create a communicating agent that inherits from **Mesa** ``Agent`` class. This ``CommunicatingAgent`` class is not intended to be used on its own, but must be inherit to create other agent classes.

If we refer to the four step mechanism presented on the previous section of the course, a communicating agent must be able to:

1. A communicating agent (sender) builds a message;
2. A communicating agent (sender) invokes a ``send`` method in the environment (through the ``MessageService``) to send the message, as one of its actions;
3. The environment (through the ``MessageService``) drops the message in the mailbox of the communicating agent (receiver). This can be done either instantly or not.
4. A communicating agent (receiver) reads its mailbox, either in a systematic manner as part of the perception mechanism in the procedural loop (*passive perception*) or on purpose, by calling a specific method (*active perception*).

The ``CommunicatingAgent`` must therefore have three attributes, one accessor method and seven methods. Go to the **agent** folder and create a new *CommunicatingAgent.py* file. Let's open this file and implement the ``CommunicatingAgent`` class

The three attributes of the ``CommunicatingAgent`` class are:

- *name*: the name of the communicating agent which replaces the unique id of **Mesa** ``Agent`` class; 
- *mailbox*: the agent's unique and private mailbox;
- *message_service*: the reference to the message service instantiated in the environment.

The acceessor method of the ``CommunicatingAgent`` class is:

- *get_name()*: return the unique name of the communicating agent.

The seven methods of the ``CommunicatingAgent`` class are:

- *step()*: the ``step()`` methods of the communicating agent called by the **Mesa** ``Scheduler`` at each time tick;
- *receive_message(message)*: receive a message (called by the ``MessageService``) and store it in the mailbox;
- *send_message(message)*: send message through the ``MessageService`` (``messages_service.send_message(message)``);
- *get_new_messages()*: return all the unread messages;
- *get_messages()*: return all the received messages;
- *get_messages_from_performative(performative)*: return a list of messages which have the same performative;
- *get_messages_from_exp(exp)*: return a list of messages which have the same sender.

As you can see, many methods of the ``CommunicatingAgent`` class are the same as the methods of the ``Mailbox`` class: we have chosen to have mailbox accessible only through dedicated methods which makes it private.

**Practice yourself!**: you can try to implement the ``CommunicatingAgent`` class by your own!

.. note::

  A possible implementation of the ``CommunicatingAgent`` class is :ref:`communicatingagent`




**Practice yourself!**

All the features of the **Mesa** communication layer being implemented, we will complete the *runtests.py* file to test the ``MessageService`` and ``CommunicatingAgent`` classes. To do this, we will implement a **Mesa** ``Model`` and communicating agents:

1. Open the *runtests.py* file;
2. Implement a ``TestAgent`` class which inherits from ``CommunicatingAgent`` class;
3. Implement a ``TestModel`` class which inherits from **Mesa** ``Model``. This model isntantiate the ``MessageService`` and two communicating agents;
4. In the ``if __name__ == "__main__":``, instantiate the ``TestModel`` and make the two communicating agents communicate through messages. Use the ``assert()`` function to ensure that the behaviors (number of messages sent, received, etc.) are those expected. 


.. note::

   A possible implementation of these four steps is :ref:`test`

If you reuse the provided code in your ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` and see all the *OK* messages appear, it means that your classes are well implemented and will behave correctly. The implementation of the communication layer in **Mesa** is now complete.

2. Concrete using of messaging communication in Mesa
------------------------------------------------------

In the previous section of the course, you have implemented an interaction mechanism in a simple Alice-Bob MAS. The objective here is to reimplement this very simple example by using the communication layer that we have just integrated in **Mesa**. Reimplementing this example will allow you to better understand how to use the **Mesa** communication layer and thus save time in the creation of the final project which will consist in setting up a communication and argumentation protocol between several communicating agents.

Alice-Bob-Charles: a concrete example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create two communicating agents named *Alice* and *Bob*. Create a third agent named *Charles* whose role is hold a variable ``v`` and process messages from *Alice* and *Bob*:

- On their turn, Alice and Bob ask Charles for the value of ``v``, using a message;
- If the value is different from their preferred value, they send a message to Charles to change the value of ``v``;
- On its turn, Charles reads its mailbox and processes all messages:
  
  - Messages that request information about ``v`` produce an anwer;
  - Messages that request a change to ``v`` are applied.

Implement the Alice-Bob-Charles example.
