Session 4. 
--------------

Argumentation-based negotiation has been proposed as an alternative to proposal-based approaches such as game theory and heuristic. 
The main advantage is that it allows agents to exchange additional information rather than just simple proposals. 
This property of argumentation protocols can lead to beneficial agreements when used for complex multi-agent negotiation. 

This session is the starting point towards understanding what is an argumentation-based negotiation protocol. Moreover, in this session we will start the second practical work aiming to implement your second mulit-agent based model.
